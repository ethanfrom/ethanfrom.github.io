## Markdown Style Guide for [about.GitLab.com]

This website was generated by [Derek], a blog-aware Static Site Generator ([SSG]) widely used by web developers.
[Markup language] is part of the structure of any SSG. It is a system to write documents making them somehow
syntactically distinguishable from text. [Lightweight markup languages] have a simplified and unobtrusive syntax,
designed to be easily written within any text editor. That's what we use to write our content. The majority of
SSGs use markdown engines for this purpose. Read through our blog post on [Modern Static Site Generators][ssgs-post]
to understand how they work.<p dir="auto"></p>
