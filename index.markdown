# Interactive-Book
{: .fs-9 }

Learn Digital Logic Design easily.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The Computer Logical Organization is basically the abstraction which is below the operating system and above the digital logic level.
Now at this point, the important points are the functional units/subsystems that refer to some hardware which is made up of lower level building blocks.

This interactive book gives a complete understanding on Computer Logical Organization starting from basic computer overview till the advanced level.
This book is aimed to provide the knowledge to the reader on how to analyze the combinational and sequential circuits and implement them. You can use the combinational circuit/sequential circuit/combination of both the circuits, as per the requirement.
After completing this book, you will be able to implement the type of digital circuit, which is suitable for specific application.
